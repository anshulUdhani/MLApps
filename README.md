* [Predict Price of Book](https://machinehack.com/hackathons/predict_the_price_of_books/overview)
  
  I secured the rank of 27 out of 3114 registration with a public score of .776 of this competition. The aim here was to predict a price of Book using Title,Edition,Author,Review,Rating,Genre,Category,Synopsis. This was a regression problem and can imagine of the solution being used by publication house to price a new launch.</br> 
  Below are some problems I tackled and solved to score .776 and secure 27th rank in this problem.
  
  * High Cardinality in Author,Genre 
  * Pattern recognition in Edition,Rating and Review
  * Missing Data and Mis-spelled data in Author
  * Free text in Title, Synopsis 

* mycustlib

  Python modules used in code help to modularize the code.
