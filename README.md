# My machine learning projects

Repository includes the interesting hackathons I participated in along with my performance in the competition.</br>
Also, includes the custom library I keep updating to modularize my code.

* [Predict Price of Book](https://machinehack.com/hackathons/predict_the_price_of_books/overview)
  
  I secured the rank of 27 out of 3114 registration with a public score of .776 of this competition. The aim here was to predict a price of Book using Title,Edition,Author,Review,Rating,Genre,Category,Synopsis. This was a regression problem and can imagine of the solution being used by publication house to price a new launch.</br> 
  Below are some problems I tackled and solved to score .776 and secure 27th rank in this problem.
  
  * High Cardinality in Author,Genre 
  * Pattern recognition in Edition,Rating and Review
  * Missing Data and Mis-spelled data in Author
  * Free text in Title, Synopsis 

* [Telestra Network Disruption Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/telstra-recruiting-network/overview)

  This is a 5 year old competition but it was recommended to me by INSOFE faculty as being one of the good resource for practicing. I was able to secure a score of .49 and around 125th rank if I would have particiapted in competition. Below are some highlights into my apporoach to the problem
  
  * High Cardinality treatment for all categorical variables
  * Feature selection using chi-square test
  * Autoencoder to reduce dimensionality
  * Stacking approach to modelling.

* mycustlib

  Python modules used in code help to modularize the code.
